						Our Story
					</h2>
					<p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
						Apex Corse is the Formula Student team of the University
						of Palermo, founded in 2023 thanks to the initiative of
						a group of students and the support of faculty members
						from the Department of Engineering. Our goal is to
						become a key player in the Sicilian university
						motorsport scene. Today, the team consists of more than
						70 students from programs in Engineering, Economics,
						Design, and Communication, all united by a shared
						passion for motorsports.

						What's Formula Student?
					</h2>
					<p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
						Formula Student is an international university
						competition that gives students a concrete opportunity
						to apply their knowledge and gain real-world experience
						in the motorsport field. Participants take on the
						challenge of designing, building, validating, and
						promoting a single-seater prototype, while also
						developing a comprehensive business plan and a detailed
						cost analysis just like in a real Formula 1 team.
